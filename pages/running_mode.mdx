# Running mode

Submodule offers two initialization mode

- Prototype, where the result of the Provider will be created on every call
- Singleton, where the result of the Provider will be cached on the first call and won't be changed the whole lifecycle

## Singleton - default mode

By default, singleton mode will be used

```typescript
import { create } from "@submodule/core"
const config = create(() => { /** load things from yaml */ })
```

the YAML part will be loaded only once and to kept in memory, further access will return the same result

## Prototype

To create a new instance on call, prototype can be used

```typescript
import { create } from "@submodule/core"
const config = create(() => { /** load things from yaml */ }, undefined, { mode: 'prototype' })
```

As such, every time `config.execute()`, the config will be loaded again.

## In use with combination

When combine is used

```typescript
from(singleton).provide(() => {/**/}, { mode: 'prototype' })
```

The singleton will be created only once

```typescript
from(prototype).provide(() => {/**/}, { mode: 'prototype' })
```
Then both submodule will be called many times
