# Why Submodule?
 
Welcome to the Submodule documentation! Submodule is a powerful and flexible Javascript/Typescript library that helps you enforce a good structure for your Node.js backend applications. Whether you're building a command-line interface (CLI) for migrations or a full-fledged backend, Submodule can adapt to your needs by acting as a composer that connects all the reusable functions in your project.

Submodule is designed to be opinionated, but its implementation details are entirely up to you. This means you can bring your own configuration loader, choose any Javascript web server or framework, and Submodule will seamlessly integrate with your project.

In this documentation, you'll learn how to install and use Submodule, as well as explore its core concepts and advanced features. We'll also cover how to integrate Submodule into your existing projects and answer frequently asked questions.
