Submodule is different to what you used to use. Submodule plays as a glue, glueing all components together so you don't have to think about it

<Steps>

### Define shape of configuration, services and context  
Define the shapes of what is meaningful for your application
- Configuration, what needs to be configurable
- Services, what services will be reused

### Choose a Route Module style
Route Module is an important unit for you to manage the project's coding style. Choose it wisely so it seems naturally fit into your team's comprehension
This is important because that's how you pass config, service and input to every functions

If you have full control over lifecycle of the application, you may want to use Server mode. If you are in an serverless environment or integrating Submodule to other framework, you may want to stick with Executable 

### Implement details following shape mentioned

### Connect everything
